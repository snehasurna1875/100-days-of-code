--------------
An attacker can use Local File Inclusion (LFI) to trick the web application into exposing or 
running files on the web server. An LFI attack may lead 
to information disclosure, remote code execution, or even 
Cross-site Scripting (XSS). Typically, LFI occurs when an 
application uses the path to a file as input. If the application 
treats this input as trusted, a local file may be used in the include statement.

Local File Inclusion is very similar to Remote File Inclusion (RFI). However, 
an attacker using LFI may only include local files (not remote files like in the case of RFI).
The ‘../’ characters used in the example above represent a directory traversal. 
The number of ‘../’ sequences depends on the configuration and location of the 
target web server on the victim machine. Some experimentation may be required.

We can see that the contents of /etc/passwd are displayed on the screen. 
A lot of useful information about the host can be obtained this way. 
Some interesting files to look for include, but are not limited to:

Linux File Locations
– /etc/issue
– /proc/version
– /etc/profile
– /etc/passwd
– /etc/passwd
– /etc/shadow
– /root/.bash_history
– /var/log/dmessage
– /var/mail/root
– /var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
