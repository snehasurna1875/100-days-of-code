--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In computing, a file system or filesystem (often abbreviated to fs) controls how data is stored and retrieved. Without a file system, 
data placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of data stops and the next begins. 
By separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name, the data is easily isolated and identified. Taking its name from the
 way paper-based data management system is named, each group of data is called a "file." The structure and logic rules used to manage 
the groups of data and their names is called a "file system."

-----
FAT
----
FAT is by far the most simplistic of the file systems supported by Windows NT. 
The FAT file system is characterized by the file allocation table (FAT), which 
is really a table that resides at the very "top" of the volume. To protect the 
volume, two copies of the FAT are kept in case one becomes damaged. In addition, 
the FAT tables and the root directory must be stored in a fixed location so that 
the system's boot files can be correctly located.

----
NTFS
-----
From a user's point of view, NTFS continues to organize files into directories, 
which, like HPFS, are sorted. However, unlike FAT or HPFS, there are no "special" 
objects on the disk and there is no dependence on the underlying hardware, such as 
512 byte sectors. In addition, there are no special locations on the disk, such as 
FAT tables or HPFS Super Blocks.


The goals of NTFS are to provide:

Reliability, which is especially desirable for high end systems and file servers
A platform for added functionality
Support POSIX requirements
Removal of the limitations of the FAT and HPFS file systems

-----
EXT
-----
Originally developed for UNIX and LINUX like Operating Systems. Its first variant 
came into market in 1992.Variant by variant this has overcome the limitations like 
size of single file, size of volume, number of files in a folder or directory. 
We have many software which could help in developing ext2 environment on Windows OS.
Compatible for both Macatonish and Windows Operating System.
